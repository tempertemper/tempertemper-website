You are viewing the pattern library for [tempertemper.net](https://tempertemper.net). You can browse the patterns using the navigation on the left.

The components and page previews are built using [Fractal](http://fractal.build/) and the [Nunjucks](templating language).


## Statuses

Patterns and their variants have been given statuses reflecting their state of completion. There are two statuses that should be used:

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Label</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <div class="Status Status--tag">
                <label class="Status-label" style="background-color: #FF9233; border-color: #FF9233;">WIP</label>
            </div>
        </td>
        <td>Work in progress. Usually not tested.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <div class="Status Status--tag">
                <label class="Status-label" style="background-color: #29CC29; border-color: #29CC29;">Ready</label>
            </div>
        </td>
        <td>Tested and ready to use.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

WIP is the default status, so any new components will have that status. Ready has to be [set manually in config](http://fractal.build/guide/core-concepts/statuses) once a pattern has been coded and tested.


## Patterns

Patterns are organised as follows:

+ Base
+ Components
+ Designs

### Base

These are the most common patterns: typography, form elements, and so on.

### Components

These are patterns that constitute a single UI element and are often made up of Base patterns and sometimes other components.

### Designs

Designs are repeating collections of components, sometimes with the odd compoent or base element thrown in (e.g. a list of components preceded by a heading and paragraph).
