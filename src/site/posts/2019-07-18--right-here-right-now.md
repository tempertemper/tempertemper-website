I [was reminded of a neat idea](https://css-tricks.com/nownownow/) the other day: the Now page. I'd seen the idea a good while ago on [Rachel Andrew's website](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/now) but hadn't had time to do anything about it. Here's the idea, taken from the [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com/about):

> Most websites have a link that says "about". It goes to a page that tells you something about the background of this person or business â€¦ a link that says "now" goes to a page that tells you what this person is focused on at this point in their life.

I like this idea a lot; weirdly more for myself than for the world at large.

One of my main goals this year was to [blog more](/blog/a-new-years-resolution-for-2019), and so far I've done pretty well. Something blogging has brought with it has been an introspection that was previously somewhat lacking, and with that has come a better awareness of where I'm at with things in my life. The things that I'm up to and those that matter most to me right now might work well as an article in my blog, but in the first instance a one-liner on a Now page feels like the perfect platform.

Being explicit with what I'm up to also feels like something that will allow me to recognise things that don't fit with where I want to be. A good screening process.

So I've [added a Now page](/now) to my website. I'm looking forward to seeing how it evolves!
