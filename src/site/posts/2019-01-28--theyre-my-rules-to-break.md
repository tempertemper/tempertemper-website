title: They're my rules to break

My new year's resolution was to write more. I've certainly been doing that, and I have begun to establish a nice routine of waking up a couple of hours before the kids in order to get some writing time in each day.

My [first article of the year](/blog/a-new-years-resolution-for-2019) outlined my rules for publishing but, even at this early stage it's clear I have to make an amendment!

One post every week was ambitious.

While I'm not one to say something publicly, only to go back on it, I learned through bitter experience last year that over-committing isn't healthy.

I've found that I prefer slightly longer-form articles—around 1500 words—to short, snappy posts (although this one is shaping up to be just that!). That may change as the year progresses, but for now I'm going to cut myself a bit of slack and aim for fortnightly posts with, perhaps, the odd shorter post in between.
