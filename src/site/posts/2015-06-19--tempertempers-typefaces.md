title: tempertemper's Typefaces
intro: |
    I rebranded tempertemper last summer. Text is so important on the web that it made perfect sense to make typography one of the first things to tackle.

I rebranded tempertemper last summer and I must say I've been very happy with the direction it has taken.

The first thing I did was work on a new logo. This provided a starting point for the typeface/fonts I would use as part of my new-look brand.

I'm a big fan of typography. I think this is because I'm a web designer and [the web is 95% text/typography](https://ia.net/know-how/the-web-is-all-about-typography-period). Even images are [underpinned by text](/blog/image-alt-text) on the web!


FS Me
-----

The typeface I used for the new logo is [FS Me](http://www.fontsmith.com/fonts/fs-me), and I chose it for the following reasons:

+ I'm an [accessibility nut](/blog/disability-on-the-web), and FS Me was designed to be as legible as possible to _anyone_
+ Because it's so legible, it makes scanning headlines on my site very easy
+ I pride tempertemper on being an approachable organisation, and FS Me is a friendly font with bags of character
+ Simplicity is one of tempertemper's core values, and FS Me conveys this nicely, without being childlike or unrefined
+ It's a lovely looking font!


Georgia
-------

I used FS Me for everything for a while, but my brand has been evolving steadily since last year's rebranding. One thing I recently added is a font to use for 'body' text (paragraphs, lists, and other general text) to complement FS Me, which I now use for headings and other 'landmark' text.

The font I chose is what's known as a 'serif' font. This means there are little kicks and flicks at the end of words, which makes reading large sections of text easier as the letters flow into words more effectively.

FS Me looked gorgeous as smaller body text on my MacBook Pro's high definition (Retina) screen, but on normal/non-HD screens it didn't look all that special.

Georgia was designed in the '90s specifically to be used on computer screens, so looks great and is easy to read no matter what device you're using.

There are a certain few typefaces/fonts that are available on every computer or mobile device, from an ancient laptops running Windows XP, Android smartphones, brand new Microsoft Surface tablets, to the most recent MacBook. Georgia is one of them and it's gorgeous. Because it's already installed in _everyone's_ device, there's [one less thing to be downloaded](/blog/webfonts) when people view my website, meaning it loads  that wee bit faster.
