intro: |
    I've found myself with extra time on my hands for the first time in years and I can't wait to pick up some projects I've been eyeing been for a while.

Last week marked the culmination of nearly a year's hard work: [2019's Frontend NE conference](https://2019.frontendne.co.uk/). Although I [stepped back from the meet-up](/blog/leaving-the-frontend-ne-meet-up) in November last year, it was business as usual on the conference front, and what a conference it was!

In the days that followed the conference, I found myself in a weird state of exhaustion and rudderlessness. Although there were a few administrative bits and bobs still to do, there was a sudden gulf where the conference had been.

After the last conference, I still had the meet-up. In fact, this time last year we had to move meet-up venues, which proved very time consuming indeed.

But this time, I have different plans. Things I've been wanting to give my attention to for the longest time:

- Get better at [writing](/blog/a-new-years-resolution-for-2019)
- Put a series of [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfqONSnrR72QblVIFnbrS5A) together
- Start planning a talk to give at conferences next year
- Really get to know JavaScript

Basically, a lot of learning!

It feels good that I've got more time to busy myself with those things I've been itching to do for so long. Frontend NE was a great learning experience, but a *huge* commitment; now I've freed up all that time, I'm ready to start learning again!
