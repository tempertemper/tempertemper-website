    <p>There are a few topics that really interest me:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="/category/accessibility">Accessiblity</a> is about designing and building web interfaces that can be used by anyone, something I feel very strongly about.</li>
        <li><a href="/category/design">Designing</a> smart, usable interfaces, journeys and interactions is what I do best, and I enjoy analysing others’ great design.</li>
        <li><a href="/category/development">Front-end development</a> is a huge passion of mine; HTML and CSS in particular, but anything from git to Gulp.</li>
    </ul>
     <p>Or have a look at the <a href="/categories">full list of subjects</a> I write about.</p>
