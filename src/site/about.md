In 2008, I was lucky enough find that _one thing_ I was 'put here to do' and had no option but to put all of my energy into a career in the web.


## Your web guy

Working with **small business** to create, establish and improve their web presence makes up the core of my work. I believe a great website is the result of **collaboration between experts**: you know your business and customers better than anyone, and I know how to translate that to the web.

Planning, designing and building your website, then improving it over time is what I get the most satisfaction out of. I have the pleasure of working with some really great clients and our long-lasting relationships have made their websites fantastic business tools.


## Freelance

I also freelance for larger teams as a **front-end developer**. I'm a real stickler for accessibility and semantics, so every line of HTML and CSS I write is carefully considered, modular and as [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) as is sensible. I'm a long-time [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/) user, compile my CSS (and do lots of other things besides!) with [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) or [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/), keep my dependencies up to date with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), and use [git](http://git-scm.com/) for version control, collaboration and hooking up deployments.


## Community

Although I'm not a Geordie, I love Newcastle and the North East, and the web design and development community here is incredible. I'm one third of [Frontend NE](https://frontendne.co.uk), a monthly front-end web development meetup and conference I co-founded and co-run. The meetup allows front-end web developers in the area come and learn more about their craft from the talks we organise, as well as put the web-world to rights over beer and pizza; while the conference draws folk in from further afield for a day of talks and learning.


## Other stuff

I'm a father of two, husband of another, and the guy who feeds our cat. When I'm not reading up on the latest CSS techniques or enjoying family time, I like nothing better than geeking out over [Game of Thrones](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Game_of_Thrones_Wiki), watching [Adventure Time](http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Adventure_Time_with_Finn_and_Jake_Wiki) or delving into the latest [Apple](https://www.apple.com/) technology.
