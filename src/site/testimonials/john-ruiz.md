> “When I instructed Martin to design my website, I had a feeling that he would be a professional who listens, and I was not disappointed. Martin was really easy to work with, taking on board all my suggestions and applying those which were likely to be beneficial to me. If however my idea was in his opinion unsuitable, he always provided me with a comprehensive explanation as to why it was not for me. Martin is very professional and his customer care is excellent. I am very happy with my website and would recommend tempertemper to anyone.”
