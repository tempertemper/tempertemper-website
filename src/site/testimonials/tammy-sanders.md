> “I hired Martin to implement a CMS into an existing website. I am based in the USA and I initially had some minor reservations about working with someone outside of the country. I am happy to report that Martin proved my concerns to be unfounded. He was extremely professional and punctual on timelines & deliverables. His communication was superb and I feel that he definitely went the "extra mile" to ensure that we were happy with the finished product. He was very easy to work with and I would, without hesitation, recommend him to anyone looking to have some web development work done.”
