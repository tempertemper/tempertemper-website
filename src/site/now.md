title: The things I'm up to right now
intro: |
    You've seen my [blog](/blog/) and [about page](/about) so you know what I'm interested in and how I ended up doing what I do, but what am I up to *right now*?

- Enjoying the challenge of a 16 kilometre (each way) [cycle to the office](https://twitter.com/tempertemper/status/1546555003560771585) twice a week
- When not at the office, getting up and going for a run every morning at 5am
- Continuing to [stand, rather than sit, for work](https://mastodon.social/@tempertemper/110281662026715175), and absolutely smitten with my new [Apple Studio Display](https://www.apple.com/uk/studio-display/)
- Three years into the [daily cold showers](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000v83f); a shower without a minute on cold at the end doesn't feel right anymore
- Enjoying watching [my football team](https://www.newcastleunited.com) when I can (I've managed to get tickets for three matches so far this season)
- Still enjoying Pokémon Go (I'm currently level 44), even though the kids' interest has waned slightly…
