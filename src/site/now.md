- Looking forward to our summer holiday in Barcelona
- Planning the next phase of our new-house-renovations: our bedroom
- Taking more time with [my wife](https://twitter.com/energybubble), now that our youngest is (finally!) sleeping through the night and can stay overnight with my parents
- Waking up at 5am to snatch an hour of writing before the kids surface
- Making a concerted effort to learn JavaScript properly after nearly a decade of tentative tinkering
- Learning about the [JAMStack](https://jamstack.org)
