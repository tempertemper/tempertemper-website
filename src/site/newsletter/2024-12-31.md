title: üéÅ An interesting present from Santa
---

The Friday before the big day, I closed the work laptop, we all squeezed into the the car, and headed to my parents' house. Shortly after we arrived a few of us began coughing and boom! Turns out we all got Covid for Christmas‚Ä¶ Luckily it didn't hit any of us particulary hard and we're all either feeling better now or well on the mend. From my semi-sick bed, I did manage to write an article for you: [Using iframes to embed arbitrary content is probably a bad idea](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/using-iframes-to-embed-arbitrary-content-is-probably-a-bad-idea)


## From the archives

I've written a few guides over the years, and one that I find really handy when giving people who are new to accessibility testing advices is [How to browse the web with the keyboard alone](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/how-to-browse-the-web-with-the-keyboard-alone). Give it a re-read and pass it on whenever you think someone needs a primer in using the keyboard to get around.


## Elsewhere on the web

Here are some of the more interesting bits and bobs that I came across from around the web during December:

- [How to Dehumanize Accessibility with AI](https://ashleemboyer.com/blog/how-to-dehumanize-accessibility-with-ai/)
- [Why are we so rubbish at accessibility?](https://carmemias.com/why-are-we-so-rubbish-at-accessibility/)
- [HTML inert Attribute](https://12daysofweb.dev/2024/html-inert-attribute/)
- [Don‚Äôt Use aria-label on Static Text Elements](https://benmyers.dev/blog/dont-use-aria-label-on-static-text-elements/)
- [The selectmenu Element is No More‚Ä¶Long Live select!](https://css-tricks.com/the-selectmenu-element-is-no-morelong-live-select/)

Anyway, now that I'm feeling better, I‚Äôm off to have a couple of beers to celebrate Hogmanay. Don't think I'll make it to the bells though! See you next year (well, at the end of January) üçª
