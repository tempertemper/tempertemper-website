title: ðŸŒ™ Ramadan Mubarak
---

Iâ€™m not a religious person but today marks the start of Ramadan. Among many other things, itâ€™s a time for reflection; something thatâ€™s all to easy to forget about in the chaos of daily life. One thing that helps me get some perspective is writing, and this month Iâ€™ve got two articles for you:

- [Skip links: what, why, and how](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/skip-links-what-why-and-how)
- [Thereâ€™s no such thing as â€˜menubar navigationâ€™](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/theres-no-such-thing-as-menubar-navigation)


## From the archives

For a second month in a row Iâ€™d like to link to my article [Not all screen reader users are blind](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/not-all-screen-reader-users-are-blind). I was reading an article by [Martijn Hols](https://martijnhols.nl/) on the EEA (European Accessibility Act) and he referenced and article called â€˜Not all screen reader users are blindâ€™, which sounded familiar. It quickly dawned on me that it was because Iâ€™d written one with exactly the same title!

Turns out [Adrian Roselli had written about it](https://adrianroselli.com/2017/02/not-all-screen-reader-users-are-blind.html) back in 2017, and his is *great*; much more thorough than my short take, but both serve to provoke thought about making assumptions.

*Thanks also to Adrian for giving my blog post a nod in the 02/12/23 update to his post.*


## Elsewhere on the web

Here are some of the more interesting bits and bobs that I came across from around the web during February:

- [Donâ€™t start testing accessibility with a screen reader](https://www.erikkroes.nl/blog/dont-test-accessibility-with-a-screen-reader/)
- [The European Accessibility Act 2025: An internet for all](https://www.wholegraindigital.com/blog/the-european-accessibility-act-2025/)
- [These (still) arenâ€™t the SCs youâ€™re looking for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADIgU53Y2Rg)
- [Atkinson Hyperlegible Next Expands on Low Vision Accessibility](https://www.printmag.com/type-tuesday/atkinson-hyperlegible-next-applied-design/)
- [How I learned to code with my voice](https://whitep4nth3r.com/blog/how-i-learned-to-code-with-my-voice/)

Anyway, hereâ€™s wishing you a peaceful and reflective month ahead, whether youâ€™re observing Ramadan or not. See you again at the end of March ðŸ˜Œ
