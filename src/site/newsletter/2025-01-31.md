title: üêç Happy new year!

It‚Äôs a new year! It‚Äôs the Chinese year of the snake, which symbolises renewal, growth, and change. One thing that doesn‚Äôt change, though: I‚Äôve written you a blog post; this one‚Äôs about [ensuring your project works in every browser and for every user](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/ensure-your-project-works-in-every-browser-and-for-every-user).


## From the archives

I remember when I first learned that [not all screen reader users are blind](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/not-all-screen-reader-users-are-blind). At first I was surprised, then it seemed so obvious, then I realised the importance of not making assumptions about disabled people.

People use digital products in all sorts of ways, whether disabled or not, and this factoid is a great way to frame that early on in people‚Äôs accessibility journeys.


## Elsewhere on the web

Here are some of the more interesting bits and bobs that I came across from around the web during January:

- [What Makes a Good Accessibility Designer?](https://davidakennedy.com/blog/what-makes-a-good-accessibility-designer/)
- [A link on a logo in the header, what should the alt-text be?](https://htmhell.dev/adventcalendar/2024/1/)
- [Accessibility of emojis for list bullets ‚Äì potential issues](https://cerovac.com/a11y/2025/01/accessibility-of-emojis-for-list-bullets-potential-issues/)
- [The Four Most Dangerous Words to People with Disabilities](https://buttondown.com/access-ability/archive/the-four-most-dangerous-words-to-people-with/)
- [Moving on from React, a Year Later](https://kellysutton.com/2025/01/18/moving-on-from-react-a-year-later.html)

Anyway, here‚Äôs wishing you a happy 2025, and I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing what growth and change the year of the snake brings! Catch you again at the end of February! üßß
