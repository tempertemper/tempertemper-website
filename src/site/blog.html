    If you're interested in web development, design, tools, business or any of the other stuff I [tweet about](https://twitter.com/tempertemper), you might find this blog interesting. If you're a website owner, you may be looking for all those resources I used to post. Don't worry, they're not gone â€“ I've moved them to their own [Resources section](/resources).
