- It meets the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) at level AA
- A good number of AAA success criteria in WCAG 2.1 have also been met
- All of the success criteria (A, AA, and AAA) in the up-coming [WCAG version 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) are satisfied

I'm not going to go into the work I've done on things like keyboard focus indicators, colour contrast, respecting user preferences, and so on; there's too much to list, and one feature is not necessarily more important than another.

I regularly use my website with the keyboard only, various screen readers, and speech recognition software. I also run automated tests with every change I make to the codebase using [axe](https://www.deque.com/axe/).

While I'm not aware of any current issues with this website, there's a chance that something has been missed or broken:

- There's a *lot* of content
- I continually tweak and iterate the design and code

If you have any trouble accessing any part of this website please [raise a GitHub Issue](https://github.com/tempertemper/tempertemper.net/issues) or [email me](/contact) and I'll fix it as a matter of priority.
