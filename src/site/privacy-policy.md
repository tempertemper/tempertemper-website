This privacy policy sets out how I use and protect any information that you provide when you use this website.

I'm committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected. If you're asked to provide information by which you can be identified when using this website, then you can be assured that it will only be used the way I will describe in this privacy statement.

The policy may change from time to time, and I'll do that by updating this page. Check back from time to time to make sure you're happy with any changes. This policy is effective from 18/10/19.


## What's collected

No information is collected without your knowing. There are no tracking cookies on this website, so the only information I will receive is what you explicitly [send me](/contact); things like:

- Your name
- Contact information, including email address
- Details of what you'd like me to do for you, whether working on a project with you or talking at your conference


## What's done with your information

Quite reasonably, if you'd like me to work with you, I'll need to know all about your project, but details of it will go no further without your express permission.

If we end up doing business, I'll use your information to keep in touch, and sometimes you might get:

- The odd email about new ideas I have for your website
- Information that I think you'll find interesting
- A designed-by-me Christmas card


## Security

I'm committed to ensuring that your information is secure. Among other things, I use [two factor authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication) on every service I use and all passwords are unique and [stored in a password manager](/resources/password-security). This is in line with [Data Protection Act (DPA)](https://ico.org.uk) recommendations.


## Cookies

A cookie is a small file which is placed on your computer's hard drive. I think these are intrusive, unnecessary and provide information that I would never use, so I don't use cookies.

I do glean *some* totally anonymous information from visitors via [server logs](https://www.netlify.com/gdpr-ccpa), which allow me to see very broad numbers on which pages get the most visitors. All information is discarded within 30 days.

Not using cookies also means I don't have to annoy you with those awful pop up banners!


## Newsletter

Like cookies, newsletters often collect data on where, when and if subscribers open an email. Again, I have no interest in any of this.

All I get is the total number of subscribers and the email address they've given me. And if I could do it without the latter I would!


## Links to other websites

This website contains links to other websites. I try to link to reputable sources, but be sure to check out their privacy statements as I can't accept any responsibility for your privacy once you've left this site.


## Controlling your personal information

I'll **never** sell, distribute or lease your personal information to anyone. Why would I? The only reason your details would go any further would be if I was ordered to provide them by a court of law.

You can ask for details of the personal information which I hold about you under the Data Protection Act 1998, though a small fee will be payable for the time it takes to gather this. If want to see a copy of the information I hold on you [get in touch](/contact).

If you think any information we are holding on you is incorrect or incomplete, please [tell me](/contact) as soon as possible and I'll put it right.


## Questions

If you have any questions about this privacy policy or your personal data, [feel free to ask](/contact).
