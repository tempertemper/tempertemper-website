Google Places is a great way to (literally!) put your business on the map. And like most things Google, it's free!

Useful information like your opening hours, services you offer, payment methods accepted, availability of parking, and so on, is presented with your business address, contact details, some pictures, videos if you've got them; the list goes on! Basically it's a way to boosting your search ranking as well as provide searchers with an overview of your business.

It works in tandem with Google Maps to give searchers an overview of your business's locationâ€“ it gives you one of those nifty little red pins in the map! This is great for people that search for a business like yours in the local area as you'll appear on the map, somewhere alongside your rival businesses.

Google verifies your address by sending you out a little postcard with a unique code on it. When it arrives through your door, all you have to do is enter the code at the web address they specify and you're away!

So what are you waiting for! Head to [Google Places](http://www.google.com/places/) and set your profile up now to give your business that vital visibility boost!
