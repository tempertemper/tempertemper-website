Google have made a few changes lately. The most recent change that's in the pipeline is [the way URLs (web addresses) are displayed](http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.se/2015/04/better-presentation-of-urls-in-search.html) in their search results.

In fact URLs aren't going to appear at all: it's going to look more like 'breadcrumbs'. Like this `Business name › About › Team`, for example, rather than `www.mygreatbusiness.com/about/team`.

Unfortunately, Google needs some extra information to be coded into a website to get this right. Without this extra info, it'll take a guess, which might not always be correct… To guarantee Google gets it right every time, you need to add 'meta data' to each page on your website. Have a quick read of [my article about meta data](/blog/what-is-meta-data) if you're not sure what it is.


How do I get the meta data onto my site?
---------------------------------------

If you want to guarantee Google gets it right every time, speak to your web designer and they'll look into it for you. It's not a big job, but is well worth doing to make sure your entry in the search results is as useful as possible.
