Meta data is website content that isn't displayed on a webpage; data that is hidden away behind the scenes.

It includes things like:

+ [Page descriptions](/blog/page-descriptions)
+ [Page titles](/blog/page-titles)
+ [Social media](/blog/giving-social-media-the-right-information) 'cards' and 'open graph' information
+ [Bookmark icons](/blog/bookmark-icons)

It's stuff that's not helpful to your people who are looking at your webpage, but very useful when your website is 'scanned' by search engines, social networks and other non-human visitors.
