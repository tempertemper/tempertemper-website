Markdown is a [brilliant way to write content](http://tempertemper.net/blog/what-is-markdown) for the web. Here's a quick overview of the most commonly used Markdown, for your reference.

## Let's start with headings

To make a heading, all you need to do is use # symbols before the heading itself, like this:

```markdown
# Level 1 heading

## Level 2 heading

### Level 3 heading

#### Level 4 heading

##### Level 5 heading

##### Level 6 heading
```

If you're like me and you want something that looks a little bit more like an actual heading, while you're writing your article, you can also pop a line of = or - symbols underneath the heading to make it a level 1 or 2 heading, like this:

```markdown
Level 1 heading
================

Level 2 heading
----------------

### Level 3 heading

#### Level 4 heading

##### Level 5 heading

##### Level 6 heading
```


## General in-paragraph highlighting

What about bold, italics and what-not? Easy! Here's how:

```markdown
_italic text_
**bold text**
```

Just wrap the word or phrase you want to italicise or embolden in either underscores or double asterisks!

## Lists

### Bulleted lists

Bulleted lists are for when you have a list of items and there's no particular order to them. Just type a plus sign with a space between it and each item, like this:

```markdown
+ an item
+ another item
+ yet another item
+ one more item
```

Don't like plus signs? You can also use minus signs (`-`) or asterisks (`*`). I prefer pluses as they stand out better. Asterisks are used for bold and underscores (which look similar to minuses) for italic.

### Numbered list

If there's a definite order to your list items they should probably be numbered, rather than bulleted. All you do is type a number and a full stop, followed by a space and anything you write after that will be part of a numbered list:

```markdown
1. first list item
2. second list item
3. third list item
4. fourth list item
```


## Links

Links are a [hugely important part of the web](http://tempertemper.net/blog/links-make-the-web-go-round). Here's how to link to other web pages in your articles:

```markdown
[linktext](http://www.example.com)
```

Surround the text you want to be the link in square brackets and—without a space—write or paste the link to the page you're referencing in normal brackets. Piece of cake!

There's also a special way to [link to other pages in your site](https://tempertemper.net/blog/how-to-write-a-link-using-markdown).

## Digging deep

If you really want to get into Markdown, a great place to start is with John Gruber's Daring Fireball website– he's one of the chaps who developed it and his [documentation](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is extremely thorough!

And, by the way, in case you're curious: I write all of my blog posts in Markdown. Any questions, [just ask](http://tempertemper.net/contact) ;)
