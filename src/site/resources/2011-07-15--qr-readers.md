I've been having a (admittedly slightly belated) play with QR codes. QR stands for Quick Response code- scan it and it works its magic!

If you got to this page via my slightly convoluted and badly thought out 'treasure hunt' then well done-  your mind must use the same twisted logic as mine! You'll already know about these QR things though, so you might as well stop reading!

For anyone else, however, they're a nifty little idea for when you're on the move- with your newly installed QR Reader app on your iPhone or Android phone, just hold the camera up to the pixelated QR code and the reader will do the rest!

The reader can do a number of things: take you to a website (for a film trailer, coupon code), give you a phone number or other contact details, provide you with text-based information about something, etc.

They've been cropping up in all sorts of places, from business cards, to bill-boards, magazine articles and adverts.

As I mentioned, they've been around a while, but they seem to be permeating the mainstream slowly but surely. As they get more and more popular, I'm sure people will use them in increasingly creative ways.
