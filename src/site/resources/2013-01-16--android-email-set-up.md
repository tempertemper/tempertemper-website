A quick disclaimer: I'm not an Android user so if you have any improvements I'd be really glad to hear from you and happy to give you a mention as a contributor to this article.

So here's how to set an email account up on your Android device:

- From the home screen, tap the Application button
- Tap the Email icon
- If this is the first email account you've set up on your phone you'll see the email set up screen. Tap 'Next'
- If you've already got an email account set up and this is your second/third/etc. tap 'Add Account'
- Tap the option at the bottom and set the account type to 'Other (POP3/IMAP)'
- Tap 'Manual Setup'
- Select 'IMAP' from the Protocol drop down list
- Enter your email address in the 'Email Address' field
- Enter your email address in the 'Username' field
- Enter your password in the 'Password' field
- Enter your IMAP server address (the 'incoming' mail server). Usually something like is mail.example.com or imap.example.com
- Security type should be set to either TSL or SSL
- The default incoming Server Port will probably be fine. Usually something like 993.
- Tap 'Next'
- Enter your email address in the 'Username' field
- Enter your password in the 'Password' field
- Enter your SMTP server address (the 'outgoing' mail server). Usually something like is smtp.example.com
- Security type should be set to either TSL or SSL
- The default outgoing Server Port will probably be fine. Usually something like 465.
- Tap 'Next'
- Head to the 'Account Options' screen and select how often your phone checks for emails in the 'Email Checking Frequency' section.
- Tap 'Notify Me When Email Arrives' if you want to know every time an email comes in
- Enter your account name (something like 'Business Account')
- Enter your name (this will be what others see when they receive an email from you)
