Having a website is possibly the most comprehensive, cost effective marketing tool you can have; providing the perfect way to advertise your product or services to the highest number of potential clients.

According to the Office for National Statistics, 30.1 million adults in the UK accessed the internet almost every day in 2010, which represents 60% of the adult population. Factor in the more occasional internet user and this number grows to an even more amazing figure! This makes a website is the easiest way to reach the most clients with minimum outlay and effort.

- An online presence can improve your business in many ways by providing:
- a constantly available 'shop window' of your business to local and global custom;
- a 24/7 point of contact;
- up to the minute information;

It has become expected of businesses that they have an online presence. Without this, you may be missing the opportunity to interest new customers or even lose existing customers to other businesses that are represented online.

## Potential Clients

The internet is the first place that most people go to look for your business and your website provides them with a tangible introduction to you and what you do, as well as a convenient and efficient way to get in touch.

Potential clients you meet that are interested to find out a bit more about you would be lost without your website. A phone call or a trip to see you may do the trick, but both of these things tend to come once they've  decided to use your product or services. The internet represents a convenient way of quickly finding out all of the information they need and—crucially—forming an impression of your business and being able to make the first contact there and then; all from the comfort of their home or office at any time they please, day or night.

## Existing Clients

Your website can be a good resource to stay in regular contact with your existing clients so they can keep up with your business's latest news and developments. This, together with, fresh, relevant and informative content, helps you to convey your authority in your field, which can encourage repeat business.
